Recursive Indexer

Note: This project was done alone as my partner dropped the course halfway through

The data structure that was chosen for this assignment was a trie. In a previous course (CS211) we had to implement a trie to read in all words and occurences from a file. From this, it was easy to modify it to include file name as a field of the trie node. Each word then has its own linked list that includes every file it is found in, and its occurences. In other words, there are two different nodes being implemented; a trie node and an occurence node. The runtime complexity of this program is O(mn), where m is number of words, and n is occurences of the largest word. Space complexity is O(m), since the only real variable that affects that is amount of words. Most of the trouble came in the formatting of the xml file; it was not something I had had to do before, so I lept running into many(albeit simple) problems. 

Also, the videos the professor posted were very educational on the ways to use and manipulate directory traversals.
